i agree but not sure the ipcc would with us we are not allowed to pursue if they aren't wearing helmets why that's the risk they choose
>by an ipccnews persecution no-one is even looked at other than by a line manager and ipcc never consider the context ie why the hell>
by ipcc style i mean thoroughly looking at individuals managers systems considering criminal/disciplinary sanctions...but competent

ipcc fixes water vapour and cloud values to prove radiative forcing with proxy data to show we are dominant cause of agw when we are not
we don't but i was making a general point about ipcc referrals they are involved in every death after contact even though may be no >

i see you´ve only heard about ipcc which is ok read nasa nature sciencemag the latest scientific findings the situation is much worse and yes i know e.g ipcc chart shows if gov'ts do nothing until 2030 that that raises cost of mitigation 15% 37% hardly uninhabitable

but anything you do is undermined and knocked into a cocked hat by the attitudes of senior management politicians media psd ipcc...😠😠😠
your belief in science is admirable but the history of the ipcc has less to do with science than politics and wealth redistribution
so it's a false premise altered data cherry picking and other lies are well documented former ipcc scientists have confirmed them as well
lol sounds like you've got it all figured out give nasa/ipcc etc a call with your findings and set them straight
you believe it because ipcc says so spend many frustrating hours on wg1 and the cited literature as i have and you will find no basis
much more importantly h2o atmos./sea/ice-cap is a complex buffer which ipcc etc choose not to investigate thoroughly

natural so says ipcc co2 emissions were way too small to affect the climate even by agw assumptions bottom like is more co2 is
prob un ipcc ar5 page 258 says maybe seas have risen 7 inches since 1901but are sure oceans rising since end of ice age 7inches worse case
climatechange does any believer have a link explaining why all 58 models missed warming hiatus ok ipcc says 4 were kinda close true
climatechange we need to give the ipcc much more to answer all unknown things found in ar4/ar5 but they went political so many dont like
many do not like the ipcc but i do i do not care for political statements at start of each chapter on how great they gotten over time
i dont trust these web sites as they spin the studies and facts leaving things out and such this is why i go to hoarse mouth ipcc ar4/ar5
the biggest denier of agw was just vindicated after 12 very difficult years of work ipcc/ soros climate seance assholes 😱🤣 😀😃😄😁😆😅🤣☺️😡🔥
the ipcc ar4/ar5 is assessment govs are suppose to make climate policy on they look at 100s of studies very good but politcal statements
there are questions on both sides i like ipcc unfortunately they went political so many dont like them we r in 3rd grade comes to climate
why checking sources is so important right now i’m not really sure what un ipcc ar4/ar5 is so i’m not prepared to debate cont

climatechange ipcc ar5 page 870 says med confidence warming hiatus 1998-2012 is attributable in roughly equal measure to cooling
funny thing if one reads the ipcc reports they are strangely bereft of confidence full of maybe might and possibly climatefraud
climatechange ipcc states maybe oceans increased 7 inches since 1901 but been rising every yr since end of ice age ipcc ar5 page 258
yet you act more like a cult member reciting bullshit nonsense that even the ipcc doesnt accept
the ipcc are an investigative body what is their body worn camera policy
great what is the proven rate of co2 forcing ipcc ar4/ar5 admit they dont know and all 58 models missed warming hiatus 2008 to 2012
technically yes but will give ipcc group 2 now
even so with all the research it should be easy to say where cli change is most likely to bite us hard too bad ipcc wg2 is such dreck
here is what is cool about ipcc ar4/ar5 first u see someone or two people write these political statements how smart they have gotten
ipcc models haven't proved true if we are on verge of cooling period our grandchildren might ask if were part of warming hysteria
see like again telegraph show me something reliable try ipcc
the reason i read ar4/ar5 all this stuff is in there but they do not put additional spin on things like these web sites ipcc is best source
do u even know what an assesment is it is not a theory it is something they can change their minds on 100% at anytime ipcc made political
lots of active research into 'known unknowns' ipcc wg1=physics wg2=biology/adaptation wg3=mitigation most 'surprises' seem for worst

the 2013 ipcc rpt also acknowledged temps were higher during medieval times 940-1200 sun activity is the main cause of earth temp chg
i think the small-bore debates about which ipcc chart leaves out what those are hard to clear on and not helpful i think
the ipcc has reduced its official forecast for temp increases in 2013 rpt they admitted that computer forecasts from 1990s were too high
ipcc estimates of future harms could also be undershoot error bars go both directions listen nytimes
and cuts the us contribution to ipcc by 100%

it also cuts the us contribution to ipcc by 100% and that's bad climate

winters shorter and less cold only during el niño events as in 2015-2016 but in 2017 global cooling will send ipcc scientists packing you're not getting it that 2c temp change is an average because winters are shorter and less cold summers not getting hotter anywhere
sea rise speeding up these estimates are almost double the minimum estimates made by the ipcc in 2013
and methane plays a major role shorter term but much bigger effect not sure ipcc models cover that

when reality does not agree with climate change theory reality is not what's false bl ipcc warming predictions wrong foxnews
the un ipcc has already admitted this scam is about getting rid of capitalism we need to get our money back world jail the lisrs it's unanimous based on the basedbased.357👌🏼 poll man made climate change is not a scientific fact carry on
to be fair using the ipcc approach of taking trend since 1880 gives you 1.08 c nh warming but linear trend problematic w/ nonlinear data
cuts those funds entirely to be clear what would specific implications for ipcc be jpvanypersele this is bad news for ipcc and international climate action if it is confirmed by congress
read the entire ipcc report please you will understand
what the hell poll findings are you talking about brett mentioned the actual ipcc projections based on probabilities not certainties
i live in iowa it's cold and thousands of miles from the ocean i do not see the downside to global warming bwahahaha the ipcc reports a whopping 3.2 millimeters per year in rise millimeters even if that triples it's only 2.6 feet in 82 years
hastings should be investigated by the ipcc for that shot remove a weapon unclip the retaining line and shoot with clear public risk

big scandal in news some years back of ipcc emails exposed showing 1 manipulation of data points to bias data toward desired outcome and
the evidence he referenced is the ipcc he agrees do you know more than he or they about the subject or is that 'subjective' there's nothing conservative or liberal about the stephens column the issue is about evidence vs bullshit he doesn't know his subject
all these organizations care quality commission ipcc access to justice freedom from torture are full of shit making out there good
even the ipcc admits there has been no significant increase since that time
a large quantity of facts which i'm assuming have been picked directly from the ipcc guide for policymakers doesn't address my argument
i also think this post by jamesannan is worth reading
not only verification but attempts to rigorously disprove ipcc manipulation of data points seriously undermine credibility veracity
he misinterprets findings in the ipcc 2014 report and he compares pollsters' data to peer-reviewed reproducible science
well that's not what the petition asks for and is a matter for the force and the ipcc not candidates trying to win votes

hoping against hope for a curtailing of systems thinking emphasize inequities power institutional dynamics end of day 1 wg2 is already burning the midnight oil almost in thinking about key themes for ar6 ipcc
the whole point of the ipcc reports was to make the science sufficiently comprehensible that global policies could be developed
and you think political scientists aren't trained to assess data to make policy decisions ipcc report was written for that target audience
new final ipcc syllabus coming soon

when you conflate political polling data with climatology misreport ipcc data you aren’t being ideologically diverse” just wrong

i don't like gospel music but that 'ho dula le ntate' track by the ipcc ladies speaks w/ my soul🙏🙏
davethompsoncc we can save a load of cash simply disbanded the ipcc for a coin so next time flip heads l retirement tails security job😎
and the ipcc is not any kind of authority on climate change even those who once belonged say they are fake news un doesn't want to lose its grip on developing countries other powerful western countries and russia remain untouchable by un
no one does which is why it is silly to set a political target ipcc does not recommend it
what you think how much co2 will be required to feed over 7 billion people according to ipcc sculptures the man-made co2 is now 6 times
according to nasa and ipcc sculptures man-made co2 increased from 20-120 ppm in the period which is 6 times 280 ppm before indus era the co2 concentration was 300 ppm and is now 400 ppm that is about 1.3 times as much co2 how do you figure 3 times as much
davethompsoncc dave is fake hope better than begging like dogs for help well we woods ipcc no that and if this side of christmas ever comes

haven't they been banned from using the word justice on all platforms until after the ipcc inquiry
are you now going to claim that all warming since 1880 is due to man ipcc only says at least half the 0.6 c warming since 1950 is manmade
there're many aspects of energy economics expert who could translate to the public findings of ipcc wg3 recent developments would be ok
ipcc climate system is a coupled non-linear chaotic system and therefore the long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible

they do make great toilet paper however for all the bs 😱🤣 please don't cite discredited ipcc reports as if they have any credibility
so follow along with stephens here stop treating every damn ipcc pronouncement as ex cathedra when they change the acolytes look dumb
please read the ipcc/pnas climate scenarios&climate research studies on the topic the illiteracy in science on both sides is disconcerting
impossible to attribute confirmed in ipcc reports
he has testified at the ipcc to the fact that 30 plus years of studying and showing scientifically that ocean levels have not risen
that little rodent just keeps posting ipcc reports and climate models like a gambler who thinks his system is going to work on next roll
my claim was that he misquoted the report and the indisputable claim omitted error i'm not agreeing with heer quoted did you mean misquoted perhaps because he gets the indisputable claims from the ipcc wrong by omitting error
op-eds claim was about evils of certitude the ipcc claiming total certainty about the science omitting the 90% ci was disingenuous
so the fact that every ipcc model has wildily overestimated the sensitivity of temp to co2 doesn't bother u
the ipcc states climate is too chaotic too many factors we don't know about to predict the future
that's interesting but the only thing i really care about is publishing yhis crap proves the new york times is sick in the head 2 for example stephens claims the ipcc says only the northern hemisphere is warming it's the whole globe
my car 🚗 a tesla is a weather modification system now well that's what the ipcc says 😱🤣 so u believe it's a myth but you don't believe that there is a weather modification system what you think tesla was working on 🤔
he said the opposite that the ipcc findings were indisputable good luck w/your reading comprehension hysteria-management classes
well i'm drafting michael farmer's complaint to the ipcc as we speak lineofduty
davethompsoncc thank god you rid of of 1 police force investigating anuther police force with accountability and replace it with the ipcc
i mean the mathematical models they use to determine the scale and timing of impacts the ipcc models don't include those feedbacks
jesus christ heer stephens said the ipcc findings were indisputable specifically said he wasn't denying the science jesus christ he didn't deny it didn't anyone read the piece
but never quote the originator of the theory svensmark 😱 the ipcc even noted that not nearly enough is known about solar output and clouds and cloud formation wrt climate they admit this 2/2
we know just because the ipcc prints it doesn't make it holy writ
let us not forget a government appointed panel agreed 97% and gave poison to socrates the same logic is behind ipcc like-minded peer rev ipcc reports are just about the most rigorously peer-reviewed studies in all of science and this is one of the most robust findings in ar5
see ipcc ar5 wg1 for abundant information chapter 10 is the one on attribution
but the ones over past 300 yrs or so ipcc does less then that are actually pretty decent even if controlling for urban heat island effect
i can feel the breeze from your arm waving don't think you'll convince me without a link you don't accept the findings of the ipcc
you're sort of right but not in the way you think i have read all the ipcc scientific reports thoroughly and they do not support the spms
ipcc have wet dreams about the kind of antics in lineofduty
no but expecting referral to ipcc lineofduty
unfortunately because supt hastings killed someone he'll be subject to an invasive ipcc investigation lineofduty
i feel like i spend all of my time trying to explain the science whilst batting of mentions of ipcc al gore and fake data that isn’t
because there's been no mention of ipcc
lineofduty ted goes all jason bourne of course in the real world he'd be immediately suspended pending an ipcc investigation
all the raw unadjusted data and super failed predictions by dumb scientists some who do have phds and garbage ipcc models proves otherwise
ipcc forbade that only al gore can say that...and look what else he says...so

the column acknowledges agw it notes correctly that the ipcc simulations have confidence intervals
ipcc is risc ltd or animus ltd linked to consultant cops to fake and falsify statments even delete and alter medical files even mh nurses
can you show me the ecologist/climate scientist peer reviewed paper that suggests that above two degrees is safe i'll show u ipcc doc
davidwondrich for what it's worth i do have a little olive branch someone pointed out to me that he did in fact get the ipcc report wrong
i suspect you would be preaching to the choir appears bretstephensnyt got confused about globe vs northern hemisphere when looking at ipcc page 194 pretty big boo boo
the ipcc predicts 11 to 38 in by 2100 has risen 4-8 inches over the past 100 years and current rate 0.13 in/year would be 11 in by 2100
3/ climate science is in its infancy google losu ipcc they used to publish their level of scientific understanding
stephens op ed games discussion of risk by ignoring that ipcc may just as well underestimate absolute certainty absurd precondition to act love nyt but abhor straw man debate about certainty when nas said enough certainty to act years ago ipcc severe irreversible harm
he says science of prediction is unclear so policy should wait but ipcc report he cites says policy is what creates variety in predictions
here's a chart from the ipcc summary source
police refuse to act when ever i report a crime or make ipcc complaints
the ipcc has over 60 models to describe this how many universal laws of gravity are there
i've read them it's possible there are locations in ipcc report where it doesn't contain error ranges but it has them
deliberate watch ipcc ref 2010/016849 on youtube
not sure who made your graph but the source of record he sites the ipcc summary report does indeed say what he said it says
page 3 of the 2013 ipcc summary report says there's been 1.53°f of change that's 85°c so there's that
you are wrong either you didn't read the article or you didn't read the ipcc report
so stephens correctly quotes the ipcc report but he's wrong because he used global rather than northern hemisphere temperatures hmm
he links to both the ipcc data he quotes and also the opinion poll he quoted both are factually accurate
agreed is it too much to ask journalists to read the ipcc/pnas climate scenarios and relevant climate research
i am and i'm not cancelling my subscription but i expect a correction regarding the use of inaccurate data appears bretstephensnyt got confused about globe vs northern hemisphere when looking at ipcc page 194 pretty big boo boo
veh manufacturers oil companies keep high production of gas gulping cars trucks they're smarter than ipcc supported climate scientists question in earnest if the earth began cooling would suvs be promoted as part of the solution
proof look at the ipcc research grant documents it was the underlying basis for pretty much all research on the topic be it directly funded
why doesn't he deserve it exactly he upheld the ipcc report and declared man-made climate change indisputable this seems to be missed
revdrbarber why does the ipcc act so immorally then
proof and the ipcc does not guide all climate scientists and yet every one confirms it so you have to posit a conspiracy
this report from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc provides an integrated view of climatechange
ha ha ha yeah ipcc real friend of the police
you defund the research that has a politically motovaited outcome the ipcc established a mandate to prove climate changes was man made not
took away lots of my productive time reading last 3 days i found that a large number of knowledgeable interested folks don't trust ipcc
ipcc ar6 scoping meeting starts tomorrow in addis ababa ethiopia this is where the working group report outlines are drafted
ipcc and zcc prayers needed
how convenient ipcc dropped co2 anthrop global warming and now crying wolf about climatechange so most folks will not understand co2 link empirical evidence shows without a doubt that anthropogenic radiative forcings are now the primary driver of global climate change
you sir are a civil engineer not a climate scientist ipcc is comprised of 2500 climate scientists from 130 countries stay in your field
rest of his thread is spot on though nyt oped only allows heresy from a narrowly drawn patch of real estate along the spectrum of ideas stephens climate denial is quoted from the ipcc scientific consensus something jeet has not done here
you think people are stupid and don't know the ipcc always covers up for police lies
yep this is a climate science denialist technique so common that it ought to have a name and it was predicated on a lie a goddamn whopper about certainty you said yourself that ipcc makes specific est of certainty-none are 100%
hi jeet would you mind explaining what precise bits of the consensus on cc stephens denied links to ipcc or meta-analyses would be good 13 even stephens's climate denial fits in comfortably with establishment it's just exxon mobile boilerplate corporate pr
we already face risks of severe irreversible harm ipcc enough certainty to act nas 2005 co2 lingers for centuries moral implications
if you're actually curious and not just trolling there are lots of good places to start learning like the ipcc reports
high coorelation between co2 emissions and world's prosperity but the un is trying to control economies of developing countries using ipcc thank you this one complements it
he quotes ipcc without noting words like severe pervasive irreversible or caution that delay increases risks including abrupt severe
if covering both sides why is there almost no coverage of those who say ipcc estimates are too conservative
reading not your strong point marcus from your own link ipcc gave that info not the police
congratulations to prof michael taylor climate change expert jamaican scientist on ipcc goj your cue
one has to wonder if mr stephens read the ipcc study to which he refers i say that he either didn't read it or didn't comprehend it 😀
then came algore fantasy movie fed by ipcc guru fooling the noble prize committee who failed 2 recognize that both had no love for humanity before mr carlson there was immanuel velikovsky very entertaining

little ice in arctic in 1922 reported by norwegians the 1st gw now dreamed by ipcc hollywoid scientists the fact mini ice age coming
no reason for doubt you are claiming certainty where ipcc doesn't
very belated reply that's my point ipcc et al keep implying more science will matter this uncertainty has to be accepted
are you ready to stop funding ipcc from public money
just for a second lets say ipcc correct paris accord reduces gw by 0.03c only by 2100 if all nations comply
ipcc ridiculesly ignores nature's co2 cycles 7billion ppl billions other beings exhaling co2 blames fossil fuel for solar/wind agenda all of the increase over the industrial era ~120ppm is anthropogenic meaning that around 30% of today's atmospheric co2 is anthropogenic
there is a significant school of thought that says the ipcc under estimates climate risks and economic and
so ipcc never settled the science of climatechange not possible in 2001 to 2015's the world to drown un hunger to overpower dev countries chapter and verse
is that mit ipcc skeptic a proven shill tho ppl wldnt like it even if he wasnt talking specifics unknowns models but richard lindzen
can you please provide the date and ipcc report ref one nasa climate scientist said something like this recently
omg the thawing and all the ipcc reports don't take the thawing permafrost into account either since it's not 100% clear yet argh
okay i guess we agree ipcc says policy and development are main factors in divergent predictions not scientific disagreement
10 yrs ago i was told off 'no balance' for giving ipcc lloyd's insurance 1m sea level rise by 2100 against hansen's 5 m in an assignment 😞

jamie schauer professor uwmadison and lead author of ipcc working group 3 very smart or marcjacobson at stanford
hope you´re aware that the ipcc placed about 3400 thermometers on the northern hemisphere but only 410 on the southern empiricaldata
to be removed from dyfedpowyspolice's files if i had allowed ipcc to return to my case would dyfedpowyspolice replace the 256 days
giving ipcc an opportunity to hide their previous mishandling of my case is negligent on my part
dr andrew weaver ajwvictoriabc head of the bcgreens 1st green mla in canada has served on ipcc 4x
strange since they knew this would be controversial i'd expect nyt editors to make sure to prevent errors like appears bretstephensnyt got confused about globe vs northern hemisphere when looking at ipcc page 194 pretty big boo boo
raw data takes very little thinking you lot that believe the line the science is settled will love it manipulated data by ipcc is lies
ipcc always is wrong
i haven't worded that best yet some on twitter say the ipcc is wrong but that is to say every scientific body in the world is pretending
yep ipcc publish a condensation of 10's of thousands of research results the results are the results they're not wrong they just are there isnt anything wrong w a conservative opinion in the ny times the problem is that opinion is treating nonsense as science

sea level is only expected to rise by a metre or so over next century unless you are an alarmist who thinks ipcc is covering up truth
when propaganda gets this detailed the part that involves what we should do about it is a complex question the ipcc report talks about this at length
they're actually pretty dead on obviously you can lie about this if you like but the ipcc has been pretty on the money
ipcc ar5 was expected to provide more detailed and more certain projections robustness assessed

in blunt words the recommendation of the ipcc is that to save our eventual great grandchildren we have to starve our children 😳
version ar5 of the ipcc report is here
if the paper refers to sensitive issues reaching far beyond basic science it is still bad news ask anyone at ipcc
my view of the ecs is it's a total crapshoot while ipcc says 3 3 is simply the median of their range 1.5-4.5 1/2

and perhaps even think about their own research thus predictions in ipcc dilluted also by gov offical input /4
the work of the ipcc fits the bill of bad science
icarus62 from an original un ipcc lead author feedback loops and ocean heat uptake by climate models may not adequately reflect the real world
the ipcc provides a range of climate sensitivities and that range makes a huge difference as to how we need to respond and how quickly
98 out of 98 ipcc predictions have failed absolutely 0% predicted the pause but do carry on with your narrative
also note what the cc in ipcc stands for founded in 1989 iirc
the ipcc has been shown to be too conservative watered down by governments he ends with idea of doubt /4
this is false equivalence he demands 100% certainty and ignores element of risk he cites the ipcc as gold standard but the ipcc /3
errors in paper ipcc relies on for solar assessment makes confidence in that conclusion unsupportable
temperature's going sideways according to the best surface network on the planet solar slowdown will have bigger effect than ipcc think

climatemarch cnn marchers need to read ar4/ar5 then they would see this is not a proven theory as ipcc admits 100s of unknowns
though you need to be aware i believe in 'climate change' and have no problem with ipcc saying more than half warming since 50s = agw

extremely likely = 95% confident is an arbitrary declaration don't believe me read the ipcc ar that's not science climatemarch
why does ipcc not mention that 95% of greenhouse effect is caused by naturally present water vapours thus making part of co2 seem large 🤔🤔

obviously you haven't read ar5 they've qualified most of the wild errant claims of the ar4 admit much uncertainty there's abundant evidence if you're prepared to accept it e.g myhre 1998 meehl et al 2004 ipcc ar5 and many others

and he didn't even mention in the article that the same ipcc panel study has been throughly discredited thanks to ice core samples
the ipcc work for the bill i know i aint mistaken their involvement.they def work for them to cover up the bad shxt not to highlight it
actually the article is quite a gem in terms of summarizing what was known pre-ipcc iow enough to light a fire under us
total certainty who is the asshole saying that the ipcc definitively not straw man climate denial is denial of data not certainty
bretstephensnyt did you even click the ipcc hyperlink you obnoxiously insisted everyone has already read kinda dishonest framing my dude

and link to the ipcc report while misquoting it coincidentally in his preferred political direction bretstephensnyt links to ipcc claims modest 0.85 degrees celsius warming of the northern hemisphere since 1880 trump would say:wrong
the ipcc numbers from 1880 aren't a dramatic increase as of today
6bis/ link to previous tweet ipcc ar5 synthesis report
6/ what the ipcc do says humans are extremely likely to be the main cause of current warming => 95-100% confidence not total certainty
3/ notion that ipcc dealing with temperature range probabilities is making climate activists' heads explode is a complete strawman
here's my big environmental idea disband the ipcc and stop acting as if co2 is some all-powerful demon why should you submit your big environmental idea to become one of the youngchamps doncheadle tells us more
yeah that seems totally compatible with the kind of uncertainty he's talking about in para beginning anyone who's read the ipcc report
all of the climate models under current ipcc theory thus far have overestimated impact all important 's when figuring out solutions
ipcc states that there is greater than 95% certainty that humans are responsible for most or all of the warming of the past 50 years
of course much ballyhooing is often made about conservative scientific estimates and even accusations of data fudging by the ipcc
bret's right i'm sure udon't think science claims total certainty even ipcc on climatechange is consensus avg of different views
and the number of countries involved and their various political needs means that the ipcc consensus has tended to be conservative
still and always uncertain but less so with time as ipcc language over time reflects
it is still accurate today and that is ok climate change is always going to be uncertain look at ipcc spread to 2100 we can act anyway
may i ask as a scientist which part of the column you took issue with he affirmed the science of the ipcc report in it
this is literally what brett stephens said no idea why everyone is getting upset at affirmer of the most important panel on cc ipcc
i think the freakout over him basically just citing the ipcc findings and revkin saying avoid hyperbole kind of proves his point
i am pretty sure revkin would say there's more evidence that the ipcc reports are underestimating the problem than the reverse
they're also going to protest against fracking no doubt which ipcc bill mckibben's gold standard credits with us climate leadership 1 sponsors of climate march 350 nrdc sierraclub are trying to kill our largest source of clean energy in the name of the climate
icarus62 this is what the raw data looks like re antarctica ice core samples much different from un ipcc computer models
any data or graphs from the un ipcc ar4 must be viewed with skepticism compare claims made in ar5
in addition ipcc rigorously dives into uncertainty in literally the first chapter
step 1 present uncertainty as a neglected or novel insight nevermind that every ipcc statement is asigned a likelihood
20 facts prove satanic ritual abuse is going on now the hampstead cover up pizzagate bbc ipcc cps election hampstead kilburn labour up and running tories don't even have a candidate yet
there are probability distributions in ipcc associated with outcome scenarios but stephens clearly was not discussing that fake op-eds i wrote a book chapter on uncertainty in climate models that stephens/nyt column is sophistry passing itself off as reasoned skepticism
there are plenty of climate scientists that would even dispute this section of the ipcc report specifically the 85 degree centigrade rise
well it depends on the climate science you are referring too he does bring up the ipcc report but not really to cast doubt on it example
ipcc criticised after taking four years to conclude arrest tactics were justified
lots of assumptions in the massaged data to support climatechange hypothesis by ipcc nasa folks scientisrs funded by them obama admin download the cet data graph it with the net climate forcing data from the nasa website or any other source and show us your results
oh my god are you objecting to a woman's right to have a baby are you in favour of eugenics hitler was you antisemite ipcc on speedial
nothing was denied he agreed to the ipcc report and just said the future is a wide range of probabilities how is that anti-science
ipcc stops short of certitude in many many places ctrl+f medium confidence
and indeed what the ipcc has been actually saying they take great pains to categorize the varying degrees of certainty
quick question does the idiocy include scientists/professors who dissent from the ipcc view
and by turning it into an opinion contest rather than a subject of thought and reason yeah how to abuse the notion of certainty in science here's what the ipcc really says sellathechemist nytimes
ok but not helping helpful distillation = distracting manipulation anyways ipcc probabilities abt magnitude not existence
this case has been ignored by tulipsiddiq and the labourparty pizzagate ipcc cps bbc
and led the terrorism arrests story with the the ipcc are investigating a police shooting no attempt at balance
click the link he provides for the ipcc report and be astonished at how dishonestly he characterizes it
2/"abrupt first ipcc was in 1991 kyoto protocol was 1997 no meaningful federal mitigation policy yet to even begin phasing in
i would just like to point out there are a number of very well respected scientists who dissent to the ipcc claims and our role in climate
no way tyler 2/3 of americans totally read the ipcc reports and were like yeah but what assumptions were built into those models hmmm
4 but within all bands it's bad and the ipcc estimates have tended to be conservative so yeah it's an ignorant column
exactly ipcc even defines virtually certain highly likely etc in terms of probability nothing wrong with stephen's comment
there's a degree of certainty and risk where failure to act is morally bankrupt ipcc warned of severe pervasive irreversible disruption
the ipcc you cited also warned of severe pervasive irreversible climate disruption what gives obstructionist right to run those risks
wrong person makes sense now interesting thoughts but really only argues flaws/limitations with ipcc climate modeling technique
